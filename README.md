# Problem Statement :
  <br />Todays world is a developing and drastically changing place.For this to happen,people are tiredleslly and continuously working day and night.This work keeps them so busy that they tend to forget to care of their health.They do take it very lightly.Later at one point of time in their lives,they do realize that they should have maintained an healthy lifestyle.
  <br />One such issue regarding health that we come across in India is obesity. 5% of country's population is suffering from obesity.Then how do we solve these health related issues?
  
 # Proposed Solution :
To avoid this,we will develop an app that monitors health of an person.The app keeps track of the weight of the person,categorize the person as an an obese/normal/thin person for his/her age and provide suggestions like what food to eat,what exercises to adopt etc...accordingly.A notification is poped to check if the person has made any progress or not.If no progress,motivates the person to achieve his/her targets.

# Methodology
1.The data is maintained regarding the BMI(Body mass index) or the normal range of BMI for the given age group and height.
<br />2.The age,height,weight parameters are taken from the user.
<br />3.BMI values are calculated(by the height and weight of the person i.e BMI value=(weight in kg)/(height in m)^2)
<br />4.The BMI value calculated is compared with the expected range.
<br />5.The output or the review is whether the person is obese(overweighed) or thin(underweighed) or normal and the expected weight for a healthy(normal) person.
<br />6.Also provide suggestions to change from obese to normal or from thin to normal.
<br />7.A notification that pops up every 15 days is added,to keep track of progress.
<br />8.Motivational videos from youtube added to motivate user to achieve targets when target not achieved
