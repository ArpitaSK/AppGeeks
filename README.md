Problem Statement:
  As India is a country which is constantly trying to increase its medical facilities .But still 5% of country's population is suffering from obesity. And as technology has developed and smart phones have become the part and parcel of day today life .One can build an app to trach some of out health issues.
  So this app concentrates on the BMI (Body Mass Index) of a person which can be considered as the basic criteria for the for categorizing a person obese or not and thus can warn them with the signs of obesity just by taking the height and weight of a person  

Introduction:
  Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight for height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m2).

Methodology:
The age of a person is taken from the user.
The data is maintained regarding the BMI(Body mass index) or the normal range of BMI for the given age group and height.
The value calculated by the height and weight of the person i.e value=(weight in kg)/(height in m)^2 is comapred with the expected range
The output or the review is whether the person is obese(overweighed) or thin(underweighed) and the expected weight for a healthy(normal)
person

For Example:
As per standards of WHO
Interpretation of BMI result using a simple chart. For adults, BMI results are interpreted as follows:
BMI below 18.5 = Underweight
BMI 18.5 – 24.9 = Normal weight
BMI 25.0 – 29.9 = Overweight
BMI 30.0 and Above = Obese

Solution :
The app says whether the person is obese or thin 
And hence can be made to suggest the remedies to get rid of obesity or underweight and hence can suggest some physical exerxises or nutrients to be taken in case of undeweight etc
